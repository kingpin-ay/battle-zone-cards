I am making a game it's a card based game so 

generate 5 cards where you will give balancing stats for each card 


your response should follow this format without deviation

[
    {
        "name": "name of a monster generate anything",
        "hp": a base hp, should be a number,
        "atk": a base atk, should be a number,
        "element": a element for this unit (fire, water , wind , earth), should be a string,
        "skill(unique)": "a special skill for this card this should be very very unique and kind of a cheat ability"
    },
    {
        ...
    }
]




two peoples are playing a game and in there turn one played this card 
p1 
{
"name": "Storm Phoenix",
"hp": 1700,
"atk": 230,
"element": "wind",
"skill(unique)": "Thunder Rebirth: Revives with full HP once per game when defeated"
},
