## Game Mechanism
- 2 player will play this game PVP 
- Picking by one cards each for each player (Predefiend 5-10 system cards - there are basically already generated and exist in the system)
- Pass those two cards picked by Our 2 players to our llm (RAG) and generate 4 cards this will be for each game generation of one time and we will discard them afterwards
- Give 2 random cards from the generated card to each of the player 

---- Round Strats ----
1. Each player will start playing the game with exactly 3 cards
2. On the first round each player will play one card in the field 
3. At a single time there can be only  3 cards present in the field
4. On each Round a player can only Attack one time from one card or use any ability , basically only one action can be performed each on a single round (replacing one action card and deploying a new card is also considered as action)
5. There is a buff round system , Counted for each player separately . A buff round will only allow you to use buf card to give certain stats or ability to one of your playable cards. if a player playes 7 actionable rounds next turn will automaticlly be a buff round. and a player can not play a buff round in next 5 turns after playing a buff round. 
5. After every 2 round you will get to pick one random card from a deck of cards (will be generated by the RAG)
6. There is a pity system in the deck card choosing (if you get buff cards 2 times in a row , next card is gureented to be playable card)
7. After deploying 3 cards once , if one of the cards gets defeated once then the game is over and the other player wins
